# Asteroid Game

Welcome to the Asteroid Game! This is a classic arcade-style game where you pilot a spaceship, avoiding and destroying asteroids to survive as long as possible. The game is developed in Python and uses the Pygame library for rendering and game mechanics.

This project was created as part of a guided project by [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev), an online platform focused on practical, project-based coding education.

## Features

- **Spaceship Control:** Use arrow keys to navigate your ship and the spacebar to shoot.
- **Asteroids:** Randomly generated asteroids that increase in speed and number as you progress.
- **Score System:** Earn points by destroying asteroids.
- **High Score Tracking:** Keeps track of your highest score.
- **Simple UI:** Easy-to-use interface with a retro feel.

## Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/michaelorina/asteroids.git
   cd asteroids
2. **Install the Required Dependencies:**
     ```bash
     pip install pygame
3. **Run the Game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py

## How to Play
**Movement:** Use the arrow keys to navigate your spaceship:

- **w**: Move forward
- **s**: Move backward
- **a**: Rotate left
- **d**: Rotate right
- **Shooting:** Press the spacebar to fire bullets at the asteroids.

- Avoid Asteroids: Colliding with an asteroid will end the game.

- Score Points: Destroy asteroids to gain points. The smaller the asteroid, the higher the points.
